this script opens new iTerm2 window with size 45x10 chars. In this new window:
1) it writes on window's title bar 'НУ И КАК ТАМ В ЕГИПТЕ?'
2) it changes directory from ~ to '.../hohow'
3) it plays Uncle.mp3 and shows 5 frames of Uncle Vernon's laughting face

issues:
if your iTerm can't find command 'imgcat', please, install shell integration
